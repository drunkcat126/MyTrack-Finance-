# üí∞ MyTrack: Financial Tracking Dashboard (Vanilla JavaScript)

## ‚ú® Project Description

**MyTrack** is a *self-hosted* and *client-side* personal finance management dashboard application. It is built purely using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, aiming to give users complete control over their transactions, budgeting, and financial goals.

With a strong focus on exceptional **User Experience (UX)** and powerful data visualization, MyTrack serves as an effective solution for managing and improving financial health.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. Advanced Tracking

* **Monthly Budgeting:** Users can set specific spending limits for each expense category and track their progress visually. The system uses intuitive color codes (Green, Yellow, Red) to alert users, helping them actively prevent overspending.
* **Recurring Transactions:** The application supports the automation of recurring transactions, such as salaries or monthly bills. Users can set them up as weekly or monthly occurrences, complete with an optional end date.
* **Financial Targets:** Define long-term savings goals (e.g., an emergency fund or a major purchase goal) and monitor the progression toward these targets directly from the current total balance.
* **Recommendation System:** Provides real-time, data-driven financial advice directly on the dashboard, including alerts for budgets nearing their limit or suggestions to optimize savings rates.

### 2. Data & Reporting

* **Visual Reports:** Transaction data is visualized clearly using a **Line Chart** for monthly income/expense comparison and a **Pie Chart** for a detailed breakdown of spending by category, all viewable by year.
* **Aesthetic PDF Export:** Users can download a professional, structured annual report in PDF format. The export uses a dedicated **Dark Mode** theme and bold fonts for high contrast and modern aesthetics.
* **CSV Export:** Provides the option to download all raw transaction data into a CSV file, enabling in-depth data analysis using external spreadsheet software (Excel/Google Sheets).

### 3. User Experience (UX)

* **Multi-Currency Support:** MyTrack allows tracking and display conversion between **IDR, USD, and SGD**.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** A fast theme-switching feature that uses CSS variables and persistently saves the user's preference in the browser.
* **Responsiveness:** The design is fully optimized for a seamless experience across all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile phones.
* **Keyboard Shortcut:** Quick access is enabled for adding new transactions instantly by pressing the keyboard shortcut **`Ctrl + T`**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Data Visualization:** Chart.js
* **Document Export:** jsPDF and jsPDF-AutoTable
